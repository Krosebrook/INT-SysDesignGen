**Staff Engineer Architect** is an enterprise-grade AI system design tool that leverages the "Staff Engineer" meta-prompt framework to synthesize production-ready architecture artifacts. It bridges the gap between high-level intent and concrete technical implementation, enforcing AppSec governance and Reality Filters™ to mitigate LLM hallucinations.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI Architecture Synthesis**: Generates C4 diagrams, API contracts, and Terraform modules using Gemini 3 Pro.
- **Reality Filters™**: Pre-flight checks for Security, UX, and Brand compliance.
- **Governance Console**: Built-in content moderation queue and audit logging.
- **Offline-First PWA**: Workbox-powered hybrid caching for reliable access in zero-connectivity zones.
- **Identity Management**: Role-based onboarding and mock enterprise authentication flows.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
- **PWA**: Workbox v6, Service Worker
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build**: Vite (Assumed) / Custom Webpack

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Google Cloud API Key (Gemini)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/intellinc/se-architect.git
   cd se-architect
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Required for Architecture Synthesis
   API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 📦 Deployment

The application is designed as a static Single Page Application (SPA).

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a `dist/` folder containing the optimized assets and the generated Service Worker (`sw.js`). Deploy this folder to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, S3+CloudFront).

## 🧪 Testing

Run the smoke test suite to verify synthesis integrity:

```bash
npx vitest tests/smoke.test.ts
```
